# Introduction

## uniprogramming and multiprogramming

单线程与多线程

## Start on OS

- bootstrap program
  - stored in the ROM
  - known as the firmware or bootloader
- bootstrap program initialize the computer (Register content, device controller contents, etc)
- locates and loads the **OS kernel** into memory
- kernel starts the first process

## User mode vs Kernel mode

### user mode

protected instructions cannot be executed

### kernel mode

all instructions can be executed

## OS events

### interrupts

are caused by external events (hardware)

### traps

are caused by executing instructions (software)

## System calls

a system call is a special kind of trap

every **Instruction Set Architecture(ISA)** provide a system call instruction

## Components

- Process Management
- Main-Memory Management
- Secondary-Storage Management
- File Management
- I/O System management
- User Interfaces
- Networking
- Protection System

# Processes

Process is an **instance** of a program running on a computer

**Operating system processes** and **User processes**

process **active, dynamic, temporary**
program **passive, static, permanence**

the **elements** of process and program are different

> Process: Process Control Block(PCB)
> Program: Code and Data

## Scheduler

- **Long-term scheduler** - job scheduling, select job from external storage to memory and create a process
  - invoked **very infrequently** (seconds, minutes) -> (may be slow)
- **Short-term scheduler** - process scheduling, select the ready process to run on the processor 
  - invoked **very frequently** (milliseconds) -> (must be fast)
- **Medium-term scheduler** - solves the problem of insufficient memory, using secondary storage to alleviate

## Context switch

system must **save the state of the old process** and **load the saved state for the new process**

## interprocess communication

- Shared memory
- Message system
  - message queue
  - Direction communication
    **name each other explictly**
  - Indirect communication
    from **mailboxes**

## Blocking vs Non-Blocking

### Blocking

is considered **synchronous**
the sender is blocked until the message is received
the reciver is blocked until a message is available

### Non-Blocking

is considered **asynchronous**
the sender sends the message and continue
the receiver receives a valid message or null
