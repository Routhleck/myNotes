Msys2

**Machine Cycle:**

- Fetch
- Decode
- Execuate



# 1. Introduction

- 1 goal
  - How to support the CONCURRENT execution of many programs in a von Neumann computer (with 1- or N-PUs)
- 2 roles
  - Resource manager, friendly interface
- 3 levels to understand the internals (Fundamental functions) of OS
  - Manage and dispatch resources [**resources are stable, no cooperation**]
  - Coordinate the programs to use resources (Synchronization and Data consistency) [**resources are stable, cooperation**]
  - Fault tolerance [**resources are unstable , cooperation**]

# 2. OS's Construction

## 2.1 Problems and Ideas in OS

### 2.1.1 Complexity is caused by the resource

### 2.1.2 Concurrency makes OS more complicated

### 2.1.3 Problem of resource competition

- Data inconsistency
- Security
- Multi-processor system

### 2.1.4 Class Structure

## 2.2 Construct OS

 We can distill 4 kinds of resources / concepts

- CPU,
- Main Memory
- Hard Disk
- File

### 2.2.1 Simple structure/monolithic structure

### 2.2.2 Modular, Layered, Microkernel

### 2.2.3 Trend - Virtual machine

## 2.3 How do user use the function defined in OS

- System Call/API

## 2.4 How to load and run OS

when turn on the power of computer, run ROM.

- POSE
- BIOS
- Boot Loader

# 3. Proccess & Thread

## 3.1 Process

• PCB (Process Control Block) is the one used/named data structure

1. Process location information
2. Process identification information
3. Process state information
4. Process control information

- Process Location Information: Each process image in memory
  - may not occupy a contiguous range of addresses ( depends
    on memory management scheme used, which will be discussed in later
    MM part ).
    - both a private and shared memory address space can be used.

- Process **Identification** Information: A few numeric
  identifiers may be used
  - Unique process identifier (PID) –
    - indexes (directly or indirectly) into the process table.
  - User identifier (UID) –
    - the user who is responsible for the job.
      - Identifier of the process that created this process (PPID). 

- Processor **State** Information: Contents of processor
  registers
  - User-visible registers
  - Control and status registers
  - Stack pointers

- Process **Control** Information: Scheduling and state
  information
  - Process state (i.e., running, ready, blocked...)
  - Priority of the process
  - Relationship with other processes
    - the process is waiting (if blocked).
    - other PCBs for process queues, parent-child relationships and other
      structures

Process Transitions (1)

- Ready → Running
  - When it is time, the dispatcher selects a new process to run.
- Running → Ready
  - the running process has expired his time slot.
  - the running process gets interrupted because a higher priority process is in the ready state.

Process Transitions (2)

- Running → Waiting
  - When a process requests something for which it must
    wait:
    - a service that the OS is not ready to perform.
    - an access to a resource not yet available.
    - initiates I/O and must wait for the result.
    - waiting for a process to provide input.
- Waiting → Ready
  - When the event for which it was waiting occurs.

**Schedulers**

- Long-term scheduler --jobs
- Short-term scheduler --processes
- Mid-term scheduler -- swap some process

## 3.2 Thread
