# 1. Introduction

- 1 goal
  - How to support the CONCURRENT execution of many programs in a von Neumann computer (with 1- or N-PUs)
- 2 roles
  - Resource manager, friendly interface
- 3 levels to understand the internals (Fundamental functions) of OS
  - Manage and dispatch resources [**resources are stable, no cooperation**]
  - Coordinate the programs to use resources (Synchronization and Data consistency) [**resources are stable, cooperation**]
  - Fault tolerance [**resources are unstable , cooperation**]

# 3. Proccess & Thread

## 3.1 Process

• **PCB (Process Control Block)** is the one used/named data structure

1. Process location information
2. Process identification information
3. Process state information
4. Process control information

- **Process Location Information**: Each process image in memory
  - may not occupy a contiguous range of addresses ( depends
    on memory management scheme used, which will be discussed in later
    MM part ).
    - both a private and shared memory address space can be used.

- **Process Identification Information**: A few numeric identifiers may be used
  - Unique process identifier (PID) –
    - indexes (directly or indirectly) into the process table.
  - User identifier (UID) –
    - the user who is responsible for the job.
      - Identifier of the process that created this process (PPID). 
  
- **Processor State Information**: Contents of processor registers
  - User-visible registers
  - Control and status registers
  - Stack pointers
  
- **Process Control Information**: Scheduling and state information
  - Process state (i.e., running, ready, blocked...)
  - Priority of the process
  - Relationship with other processes
    - the process is waiting (if blocked).
    - other PCBs for process queues, parent-child relationships and other
      structures

Process Transitions (1)

- Ready → Running
  - When it is time, the dispatcher selects a new process to run.
- Running → Ready
  - the running process has expired his time slot.
  - the running process gets interrupted because a higher priority process is in the ready state.

Process Transitions (2)

- Running → Waiting
  - When a process requests something for which it must
    wait:
    - a service that the OS is not ready to perform.
    - an access to a resource not yet available.
    - initiates I/O and must wait for the result.
    - waiting for a process to provide input.
- Waiting → Ready
  - When the event for which it was waiting occurs.

**Schedulers**

- Long-term scheduler --jobs
- Short-term scheduler --processes
- Mid-term scheduler -- swap some process

**IPC： Inter-Process Communication**

- Cooperating processes require an inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism that will allow them to exchange data and information.
- There are two fundamental models of inter-process communication:
  - Shared memory
  - Message passing
    - message passing interfaces, mailboxes and message queues
    - sockets, STREAMS, pipes

## 3.2 Thread

Process switching is **EXPENSIVE**!

Concept of Process has two facets
A Process is:

- **A Unit of resource ownership** – process is allocated:
  - a virtual address space for the process image
  - control of some resources (files, I/O devices...)
- **A Unit of execution/dispatching** - process is an execution path through one or more programs (functions, code segments)
  - may be interleaved with other processes
  - execution state (Ready, Running, Blocked...) and dispatching priority

– The unit of resource ownership is referred to as a Task or (for historical reasons) also as a **Process**.
– The unit of dispatching is referred to a **Thread**.

# 4. CPU Scheduling

## 4.1 Basic Concept

**CPU-I/O Burst**

- Burst/Service time = total processor time needed in one CPU-I/O burst cycle.
- Jobs/Process with long CPU burst time are **CPU- bound jobs/processes** and are also referred to as “long jobs/processes”.
- Jobs with short CPU burst time are **IO-bound jobs/processes** and are also referred to as “short jobs/processes”.
- CPU-bound processes have longer CPU bursts than I/O-bound processes.

## 4.2 Scheduling Criteria & Metrics

**Parameters to evaluate the scheduling**

- CPU utilization [ **CPU 使用率** ] ( Efficiency )
  - keep the CPU as busy as possible (from 0% to 100%)
- Fairness: each process gets a “fair share” of the CPU
- Throughput [ **吞吐量** ]
  -  of processes that complete their execution per time unit
- Turnaround time [ **周转时间** ]
  - amount of time to execute a particular Process
    • i.e. execution time + waiting time
- Waiting time [ **等待时间** ]
  - amount of time a process has been waiting in the ready queue
- Response time [ **响应时间** ]
  - amount of time it takes from when a request was submitteduntil the first response is produced , not output (for time-sharing environment)

**Scheduling Algorithms**

- First Come First Serve Scheduling [ **先来先服务** ] ( Non-preemptive )
- Shortest Job First Scheduling [ **最短任务先服务** ]
  - SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First Scheduling)/SRJF
- Priority Scheduling [ **优先权** ]
- Round-Robin Scheduling [ **时间片轮转** ]
- Multilevel Queue Scheduling [ 多层次队列 ]
  - Multilevel Feedback-Queue Scheduling [ 多层次反馈队列 ]
- Lottery Scheduling [ 抽彩 ]
