## Parallel heat equation with Cython kernel

In this exercise we finalize the optimization of heat equation solver by 
implementing parallel program with Cythonized kernel.

That is, you should combine the implementations in 
[Parallel heat equation](../heat-equation) and in 
[Cythoning heat equation](../../cython/heat-equation).
