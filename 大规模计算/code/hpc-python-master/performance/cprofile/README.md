## Using cProfile

In this exercise we analyze the performance of heat equation solver with cProfile.

The file [heat_main.py](heat_main.py) contains the (very inefficient)
implementation of the two dimensional heat equation. Use `cProfile` for
investigating where the time is spent in the program. Note that the execution 
time can be between 40 - 60 s depending on your hardware. (You can see also 
results of the simulation in the *heat_nnn.png* output files).
