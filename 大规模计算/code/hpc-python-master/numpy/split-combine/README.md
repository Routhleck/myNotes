## Split and combine arrays

Create a new 8x8 array with some values (or continue with the one created in
the [Array slicing](../array-slicing) exercise).

1. Use `np.split()` function for splitting the array into two new 4x8 arrays.
   Reconstruct the original 8x8 array by using `np.concatenate()`.
2. Repeat the above exercise but create now 8x4 subarrays and then combine
   them.
