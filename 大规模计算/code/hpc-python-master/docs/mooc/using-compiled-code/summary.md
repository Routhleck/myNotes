<!-- Title: Week 3 summary -->

<!-- Short description:

Short summary of week three.

-->

We hope that you have enjoyed the third week of Python in High Performance
Computing!

This week, we have discussed Cython, optimising static compiler for
Python. By adding static type definitions into existing Python module (using
Cython extension language) one can in best cases obtain over hundred-fold
speed-ups. We also discussed how existing libraries (with C interface) or
existing C and Fortran code can be interfaced with different Python tools.

By now, you should know how to transfer dynamic Python code into a more static
compiled code with the help of Cython, as well as how to utilize C or Fortran
code from Python.

Next week, we will explore the amazing wonderland of parallel computing and
learn how to use multiple CPU cores with MPI for Python.
