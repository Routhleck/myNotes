<!-- Title: Week 2 summary -->

<!-- Short description:

Short summary of week two.

-->

We hope that you have enjoyed the second week of Python in High Performance
Computing!

This week, we have looked into NumPy arrays and how to use them for more
efficient numerical calculations. By using fixed size, uniformly typed
data arrays, it enables one to leverage the performance of optimised numerical
libraries directly from Python.

By now, you should know how to create and manipulate NumPy arrays, how to do
numerical calculations with them, and how to use simple vectorised operations.
You should also understand the key differences, such as data layout in memory,
between Python lists and NumPy arrays, as well as the memory consumption of
temporary arrays and how to mitigate for it.

Next week, we will explore how to use static compiled code to speed things up
in Python.
