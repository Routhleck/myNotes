<!-- Short description:

Short summary of week one.

-->

We hope that you have enjoyed the first week of Python in High Performance
Computing!

This week, we have discussed various performance challenges in Python
programs and have set up the programming environment for the course. We
have also introduced various ways of investigating the performance of Python
programs. We hope that you remember the number one rule in performance
optimization:

> Measure before you optimize!

By now, you should know how to use the `cProfile` profiling tool which is
included in the Python standard library.

Next week, we will look into how to use fixed size, uniformly typed NumPy
arrays to get more performance in Python.
