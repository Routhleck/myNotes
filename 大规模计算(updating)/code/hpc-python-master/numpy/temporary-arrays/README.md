## Temporary arrays

Try different NumPy array expressions and investigate how much memory is used
in temporary arrays. You can use the Unix command `/usr/bin/time â€“v ` for
finding out the maximum memory usage of program, or utilize the `maxmem()`
function in [demos/memory_usage.py](../../demos/memory_usage.py).
