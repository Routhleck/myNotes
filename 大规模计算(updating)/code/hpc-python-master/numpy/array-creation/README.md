## Array creation

1. Start from a Python list containing both integers and floating point values,
and construct then a NumPy array from the list.

2. Generate a 1D NumPy array containing all numbers from -2.0 to 2.0 with a
spacing of 0.2. Use optional start and step arguments of the `np.arange()`
function.

3. Generate another 1D NumPy array containing 11 equally spaced values between
0.5 and 1.5. 

4. Take some Python string and construct from it NumPy array consisting of 
single characters (a character array).
